# 💼 Salary Prediction App


This is my internship project developed as part of the **AI & ML Internship Program** by **Edunet Foundation in collaboration with IBM**.

The project is a simple yet effective **Streamlit web application** that predicts employee salaries based on **years of experience** using a **Linear Regression** model.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload your own salary dataset (CSV)
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Visualize the regression line
- Predicts employee salary based on:
  Education
  Experience
  Location
  Job Title
  Age
  Gender
- Interactive UI powered by Streamlit

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Files in the Repo

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `salary_pred.py` | Main Streamlit app code |
| `Salary Data.csv` | Sample dataset used for training |
| `requirements.txt` | Required Python packages |
| `README.md` | Project description |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a CSV file or uses the default salary dataset.
2. The Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset.
3. A regression line is plotted to visualize the fit.
4. The user inputs a number (Years of Experience).
5. The app predicts the expected salary based on the trained model.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple input features (Job Role, Location, Education, etc.)  
- Enable saving uploaded datasets for later use  
- Model selection between Linear, Decision Tree, or Random Forest  
- Allow CSV export of predictions
